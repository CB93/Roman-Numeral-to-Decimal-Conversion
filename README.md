# Roman-to-Decimal-Conversion

Roman_Decimal.exe converts Roman number system values into their equivalent Hindu-Arabic number system values

## In order to fulfill subtractive notation:

My solution uses an algorithm where any Roman numeral digit which proceeds another Roman numeral digit and is 
of less value, is subtracted from the total sum rather than being added to the total sum.

## Output Example 1:

```
Input Roman numeral #: 7  mlxvi
MLXVI = 1066
```

## Output Example 2:

```
Input Roman numeral #: 3  W
W Error - last character was not valid!!!
```

## Output Example 3:

```
Input Roman numeral #: 10  MDMDCDCLCLXLXVXVIVIII
MDMDCDCLCLXLXVXVIVIII = 2667
```
